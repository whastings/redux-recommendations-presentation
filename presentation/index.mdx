# Redux Recommendations
#### Will Hastings &ndash; 10/15/19

- What is Redux?

# Overview

- Reduce Boilerplate with Utilities
- Simplify API Calls with Middleware
- Improve Code Structure with Ducks

# Reduce Boilerplate with Utilities

---

##### Reduce Boilerplate with Utilities
### Action Creators

- Writing simple action creators by hand is tedious
- Defining separate action type constants and action creator functions is a lot
- With a utility, can be one line for many action creators

<Notes>

- What is an action creator?

</Notes>

---
export default CodeSlide

<CodePane
  source={require('!raw-loader!./examples/withoutCreateAction.js')}
/>

<Notes>

- Vanilla Redux
- Separate action type constant and creator function
- Grows big when you have a lot of actions

</Notes>

---
export default CodeSlide

<CodePane
  source={require('!raw-loader!./examples/createAction.js')}
/>
<CodeRunner name="createAction" importer={() => import('./examples/createAction')} />

<Notes>

- Example from redux-starter-kit library
- From the Redux core team
- Provides `createAction` utility
- Run code
  - `actionCreator.type`
  - Returned action object

</Notes>

---

##### Reduce Boilerplate with Utilities
### Reducers

- Prefer utilities to `switch`
- Code in `case` sections isn't really isolated
- You have to watch for the dreaded forgotten `break`

<Notes>

- What is a reducer?

</Notes>

---
export default CodeSlide

<CodePane
  source={require('!raw-loader!./examples/switchReducer.js')}
/>

<Notes>

- Basic `switch` reducer example
- Each action type gets a `case`
- Don't forget to `break`
- `case`s not isolated

</Notes>

---
export default CodeSlide

<CodePane
  source={require('!raw-loader!./examples/utilReducer.js')}
/>

<Notes>

- Utility example
- Map argument
- Returns reducer
- Forwards action to correct function
- No `switch` boilerplate (e.g. `break`)
- Code isolated

</Notes>

---
export default CodeSlide

<CodePane
  source={require('!raw-loader!./examples/createReducer.js')}
/>

<Notes>

- Implementing is straightforward
- Function that takes reducer map
- Returns reducer function
- Looks up and execute
- Or returns same state

</Notes>

---
export default CodeSlide

<CodePane
  source={require('!raw-loader!./examples/rskReducer.js')}
/>
<CodeRunner name="rskReducer" importer={() => import('./examples/rskReducer')} />

<Notes>

- redux-starter-kit util
- Also takes map
- Action creators can be keys
- Uses Immer.js
- Update still immutable
- Run code:
  - Proves state was updated immutably

</Notes>

# Simplify API Calls with Middleware

<Notes>

- What is a middleware?

</Notes>

---

##### Simplify API Calls with Middleware
### Problem Statement

- Manual API calls lead to boilerplate
- Loading and error states handled inconsistently or not at all
- Manual code requires more work to test

<Notes>

- Boilerplate
- Inconsistent handling
- Testing is more work

</Notes>

---
export default CodeSlide

<CodePane
  source={require('!raw-loader!./examples/manualApiCall.js')}
/>

<Notes>

- redux-thunk example
  - Is a middleware too
  - Provides `dispatch`
- Three actions to `dispatch`
- Tests mostly same every time
  - More mocking
- Can't use `catch`

</Notes>

---
export default CodeSlide

<CodePane
  source={require('!raw-loader!./examples/declarativeApiCall.js')}
/>
<CodeRunner name="declarativeApiCall" importer={() => import('./examples/declarativeApiCall')} />

<Notes>

- Example w/ API call middleware
- Utility for action types
- Action creator returns plain action
  - `CALL_API` type
  - Actions to fire
  - Request details
- Run code:
  - Middleware fires start and success
- Unit test action contents

</Notes>

---
export default ApiMiddlewareWalkthrough

- Important to understand your abstractions
  - How they work
  - When to use them
- Walkthrough middleware

---

##### Simplify API Calls with Middleware
### Libraries

- [redux-api-middleware](https://github.com/agraboso/redux-api-middleware)
- [redux-api](https://github.com/lexich/redux-api)

<Notes>

- Can use library
- redux-api-middleware seems pretty solid
- But remember to understand your abstractions

</Notes>

# Improve Code Structure with Ducks

---

##### Improve Code Structure with Ducks
### What's a Duck?

- [ducks-modular-redux](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) describes the "Ducks" pattern
- Put a feature's action types, actions creators, and reducer in same file (a "Duck")
- Keeps you from jumping around so much
- Follows "code that changes together should live together" principle

<Notes>

- Traditionally, separate action and reducer files
  - Sometimes separate directories
- "Duck" is a pattern
- Proposed by Erik Rasmussen
- All in same file
  - For given functionalty
  - Not everything in one file
- Less jumping

</Notes>

---
export default CodeSlide

<CodePane
  source={require('!raw-loader!./examples/duck.js')}
/>

<Notes>

- Define types, creators, and reducer
- Recommend `createAction`
- Action creators as named exports
- Reducer as default export

</Notes>

---
export default CodeSlide

<CodePane
  source={require('!raw-loader!./examples/rskDuck.js')}
/>
<CodeRunner name="rskDuck" importer={() => import('./examples/rskDuck')} />

<Notes>

- `createSlice` from rsk
- Even less boilerplate
- Creates everything from reducers map
- Return object with `.reducer` and `.actions`
- May be taking too far...
- Run code:
  - Reducer prop
  - Action creators map
  - Example action creator call

</Notes>

# Conclusion

---

##### Conclusion
### Summary

- Use utilities to reduce boilerplate and increase maintainabilty
- Build abstractions like middleware to simplify common patterns
- Keep related code close together

<Notes>

- Utilities
  - Less boilerplate
  - More maintainable
  - Faster velocity
- Abstractions simplify patterns
  - e.g. API calls
  - BUT UNDERSTAND THEM
- Easier to change related code if it lives together

</Notes>
